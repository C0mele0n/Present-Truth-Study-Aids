This story of Joash (king of Israel) going against Amaziah and the people of Judah because of idolatry is found in [[2 Chronicles]] , [[2 Kings]]

[2Ch 25:23](verseid:14.25.23)  And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

[2Ch 25:24](verseid:14.25.24)  And _he took_ all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.

[2Ch 25:25](verseid:14.25.25)  And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

[2Ch 32:5](verseid:14.32.5)  Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised _it_ up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo _in_ the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.

[2Ch 32:6](verseid:14.32.6)  And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,

[2Ch 32:7](verseid:14.32.7)  Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that _is_ with him: for _there be_ more with us than with him:

[2Ch 32:8](verseid:14.32.8)  With him _is_ an arm of flesh; but with us _is_ the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

> This story has many similarities to an account of Antiochus concerning God's people:

[1Ma 1:29](verseid:72.1.29)  And after two years fully expired the king sent his chief collector of tribute unto the cities of Juda, who came unto Jerusalem with a great multitude,

[1Ma 1:30](verseid:72.1.30)  And spake peaceable words unto them, but all was deceit: for when they had given him credence, he fell suddenly upon the city, and smote it very sore, and destroyed much people of Israel.

[1Ma 1:31](verseid:72.1.31)  And when he had taken the spoils of the city, he set it on fire, and pulled down the houses and walls thereof on every side.

[1Ma 1:32](verseid:72.1.32)  But the women and children took they captive, and possessed the cattle.

[1Ma 1:33](verseid:72.1.33)  Then builded they the city of David with a great and strong wall, and with mighty towers, and made it a strong hold for them.

[1Ma 1:34](verseid:72.1.34)  And they put therein a sinful nation, wicked men, and fortified themselves therein.

[1Ma 1:35](verseid:72.1.35)  They stored it also with armour and victuals, and when they had gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem, they laid them up there, and so they became a sore snare:

[1Ma 1:36](verseid:72.1.36)  For it was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel.

[1Ma 1:37](verseid:72.1.37)  Thus they shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled it:

[1Ma 1:38](verseid:72.1.38)  Insomuch that the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them: whereupon the city was made an habitation of strangers, and became strange to those that were born in her; and her own children left her.
