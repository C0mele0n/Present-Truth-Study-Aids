[Dan 9:24](verseid:27.9.24)  Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.
[Dan 9:25](verseid:27.9.25)  Know therefore and understand, _that_ from the going forth of the commandment to [[Rebuilding the temple|restore and to build Jerusalem]] unto the Messiah the Prince _shall be_ seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.

The beginning of the 70 weeks = 457BC:
[Ezr 7:8](verseid:15.7.8)  And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which _was_ in the seventh year of the king.
[Ezr 7:13](verseid:15.7.13)  I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and _of_ his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.
