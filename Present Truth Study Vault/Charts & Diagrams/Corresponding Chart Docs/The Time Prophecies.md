### The 2520 Time Periods
Before Israel reached the land which God promised to Abraham, God gave them conditions to which they must meet in order to preserve their stay in the land (See [[Exod 20]] for example). He also gave His people a conditional forcast to their future based on whether they kept His requirements or not. If Israel chose to live an act according to the ways God laid out, they would be blessed, made secure, and caused to grow. If they chose to walk contrary, they would ultimetly forfit God's protection and favor: opening the door for woe, exile, captivity and death. However, God would not allow His people to face the worst immedietly. Instead, He would, as a Father, correct them in stages. Here is where we find the reference to the 2520 periods (which became history after Israel walked contrary to God in the promised land: both Israel and Judah receiving their own 2520 period). Where the list of punishments begin in [[Lev 26#14]], the 2520 time periods (or "7 times" as is mentioned in scripture) can be found referenced in [[Lev 26#|Leviticus 26:18]] and onward. Here is the full chapter (in a scrollable frame) below:
![[Lev 26]]


#### The Context
[Lev 25:1](verseid:3.25.1)  And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

[Lev 25:2](verseid:3.25.2)  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, ==When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.==

[Lev 25:3](verseid:3.25.3)  Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

[Lev 25:4](verseid:3.25.4)  ==But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.==

[Lev 25:5](verseid:3.25.5)  That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: _for_ it is a year of rest unto the land.

[Lev 25:6](verseid:3.25.6)  And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,

[Lev 25:7](verseid:3.25.7)  And for thy cattle, and for the beast that _are_ in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.

[Lev 25:8](verseid:3.25.8)  And ==thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years==.

[Lev 25:9](verseid:3.25.9)  Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth _day_ of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

### References to the "seven times"
[[Lev 26#21]], [[Lev 26#24]], [[Lev 26#28]], [[Dan 4#16]], [[Dan 4#23]], [[Dan 4#25]], [[Dan 5#25]], [[Dan 5#26]]

### The Purpose  of the Seven Times
[Lev 26:34](verseid:3.26.34)  Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye _be_ in your enemies' land; _even_ then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

[Lev 26:35](verseid:3.26.35)  As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

### General Prophetic Reckoning 
- A Biblical month is 30 days: [[Gen 7#11]], [[Gen 7#24]], [[Gen 8#3]], [[Gen 8#4]].
- 1 time in Lev 26 is a year: [[Lev 25#8]], [[Lev 26#34]]. (See the 4th footnote under [[1798]])
- Day for a year principle: [[Lev 25#4]], [[Num 14#34]], [[Ezek 4#6]], [[Gen 29#27]]. (See the 5th footnote under [[1798]])
> So: 30 days x 12 months is 360 days per Biblical year. 7 times 360 days is 2520 days. With the day for a year principle, 2520 days can be interpreted as 2520 literal years. As we put the other prophetic periods together, we will see even more that this is the case.

❗ As you go over the materials for the dates below, you will see the use of these time-reckoning principles confirmed. Also, seeing that the existance of the 2520 prophecy has been a point of controversy amongst some, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8XDUQ2fB28&list=PLz8q63xKec66zY8BlfOVo-6TN5u57rqqr&index=3) (which gives a good overview, including more general detail, and explores arguments for and against the prophecy). Above all, "Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." [[2 Tim 2#15]].
