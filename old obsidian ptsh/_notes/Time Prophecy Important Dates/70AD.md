Jerusalem fell in A. D. 70. As an honor to himself, the Roman commander had determined to 
save the temple; but the Lord had said that there should not remain one stone upon another 
which should not be thrown down. A Roman soldier seized a brand of fire, and, climbing upon 
the shoulders of his comrades, thrust it into one of the windows of the beautiful structure. It was 
soon in the arms of the devouring element. The frantic efforts of the Jews to extinguish the 
flames were seconded by Titus himself, but all in vain. Seeing that the temple must perish, Titus 
rushed in, and bore away the golden candlestick, the table of show-bread, and the 
volume of the law, wrapped in golden tissue. The candlestick was afterward deposited in 
Vespasianâ€™s Temple to Peace, and copied on the triumphal arch of Titus, where its mutilated 
image is yet to be seen. DAR 251.2
