- Constantine removed the seat of from Rome and transfers it to Constantinople (TBI 97.1^[The dragon gave his seat, power and great authority to some other power represented by the following beast like a leopard. [Revelation 13:1-10](1965.63067). To what was the dragonâ€™s seat, ancient Rome, given up? Answer. To the papacy. The seat of empire was moved to Constantinople, and the bishop of Rome soon ascended in the city of Rome, a higher throne than her pagan emperors had ever occupied. Great power was given to him; or, in other words, supremacy was conferred upon him, by the decree of Justinian, emperor of the East, carried out in 538. The parallel between this beast, [Revelation 13:5-10](1965.63075), and the little horn of the fourth beast of [Daniel 7:21, 25, 27](1965.44795), conclusively shows that it represents the papacy. This being so the time of his captivity, [verse 10](1965.44773), was at the end of the 1260 years in 1798. TBI 97.1])
	- Fulfillment of the "seat" part of [[Rev 13#2]]: the removal of the seat from Rome left it open for the bishop of Rome to soon take his seat upon Rome.
	- Rome still had to obtain power and great authority
