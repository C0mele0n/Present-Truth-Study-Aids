Persecution of the jews (by Nero) ceased (p. 122. HST October 26, 1842, p. 46.10^[Having shown, as he supposes, that this persecuting power is Nero, he proceeds, “Turn we now to the pages of history, and we shall find that Nero commenced his horrible persecution of christians about the middle, or in the latter part of November, A. D. 64. All agree that this persecution ended immediately on the death of Nero; and this took place on the day that Galba entered Rome, and was proclaimed emperor on the 9th of June, A. D. 68. Here then is the often repeated and peculiar period of three and an half years, being only a few days of excess beyond that measure of time. By this small excess of only a few days no one of course can be stumbled; for how is it reasonable to suppose, that in respect to a celebrated period, so often repeated, and already become so famous, a statistical exactness would or could be aimed at? Enough that only a few days at most can be considered as supernumerary.” p. 122. HST October 26, 1842, p. 46.10])
