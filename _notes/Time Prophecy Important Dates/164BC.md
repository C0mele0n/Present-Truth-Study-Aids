## Death of Antiochus Epiphanies 
[1Ma 6:8](verseid:72.6.8)  Now when the king heard these words, he was astonished and sore moved: whereupon he laid him down upon his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not befallen him as he looked for.

[1Ma 6:9](verseid:72.6.9)  And there he continued many days: for his grief was ever more and more, and he made account that he should die.

[1Ma 6:10](verseid:72.6.10)  Wherefore he called for all his friends, and said unto them, The sleep is gone from mine eyes, and my heart faileth for very care.

[1Ma 6:11](verseid:72.6.11)  And I thought with myself, Into what tribulation am I come, and how great a flood of misery is it, wherein now I am! for I was bountiful and beloved in my power.

[1Ma 6:12](verseid:72.6.12)  But now I remember the evils that I did at Jerusalem, and that I took all the vessels of gold and silver that were therein, and sent to destroy the inhabitants of Judea without a cause.

[1Ma 6:13](verseid:72.6.13)  I perceive therefore that for this cause these troubles are come upon me, and, behold, I perish through great grief in a strange land.

[1Ma 6:14](verseid:72.6.14)  Then called he for Philip, one of his friends, who he made ruler over all his realm,

[1Ma 6:15](verseid:72.6.15)  And gave him the crown, and his robe, and his signet, to the end he should bring up his son Antiochus, and nourish him up for the kingdom.

[1Ma 6:16](verseid:72.6.16)  So king Antiochus died there in the hundred forty and ninth year.
